    "This is Udacity's second project under Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. This project focused on the general data analysis process by using Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib (Completed on November 26, 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, our goal was to gain onhand experience with the data analysis process. As part of this project, we were familiarize ourselves with the typical data analysis process, pose questions about our chosen dataset, know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle data, experience communicating results, be able to vectorize operations in NumpPy and Pandas, be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, and know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do want to make note that the goal of this project does not include inferential statistics or any machine learning techniques. This project's goals were to master the Data Analysis process by investigating a dataset from a list of given options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be analyzing The Movie Database (TMDb) which contains information of over 10,000 films.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in taking a look at what makes a film successful. Success can take on a multitude of definitions but for our analysis, we shall define success as a film being both financially and critically well received.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis of the TMDb Movie Data, we will focus on the film's revenue (and profit) as well as the average voting score.\n",
